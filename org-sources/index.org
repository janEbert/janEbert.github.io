Hey, I'm Jan (or [[https://github.com/janEbert][janEbert on GitHub]])! I like optimizing loops,
thinking in parallel, applying mathematics, and hardcore challenges.

For some years, I've been heavily invested in deep learning; my
favorite projects include:
- [[https://github.com/janEbert/SMWLevelGenerator][Super Mario World level generation framework]]
- [[https://github.com/janEbert/rldurak][Reinforcement learning for Durak]]
- [[https://github.com/janEbert/GANerator][Generative adversarial network framework]]

As I have noticed some interest in the project, I am currently working
on a rewrite of the Durak reinforcement learning environment in [[https://rust-lang.org][Rust]].
This will result in a high-performance [[https://github.com/openai/gym][Gym]] environment striking the
fine balance between a relatively simple but reward-sparse
reinforcement learning task. An optimal agent needs to plan for the
future to obtain the delayed win-or-lose reward.\\
Aside from that, Durak is also really fun!
