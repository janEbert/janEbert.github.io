Hey, I'm Jan (or [[https://github.com/janEbert][janEbert on GitHub]])! I like optimizing loops,
thinking in parallel, applying mathematics, and hardcore challenges.

For some years, I've been heavily invested in deep learning; my
favorite projects include:
- [[https://github.com/janEbert/SMWLevelGenerator][Super Mario World level generation framework]]
- [[https://github.com/janEbert/rldurak][Reinforcement learning for Durak]]
- [[https://github.com/janEbert/GANerator][Generative adversarial network framework]]

I'm currently working at the [[https://www.helmholtz.ai/themenmenue/our-research/consultant-teams/helmholtz-ai-consultants-fzj/index.html][Helmholtz AI]] division of the [[https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Home/home_node.html][Jülich
Supercomputing Centre]]. Some of the projects I'm currently working on
include:
- [[https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Meldungen/IAS/JSC/EN/2020/2020-07-alphanumerics-zero.html][AlphaNumerics Zero]]: Using reinforcement learning to optimize a
  numerical solver.
- Reproducing OpenAI's [[https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/][DALL-E]] model.
- [[https://mlcommons.org/en/][MLCommons]] MLPerf benchmarks.

Recently, I've also become interested in [[https://triton-lang.org/][Triton]], the next machine
learning kernel compiler running on /your/ GPU! I hope to be able to
invest some time in this.
